# Machine Learning Models: Cancer Cases and Treatment Costs

This is a project for a course to learn about various ML models and their applications. The dataset was obtained from [here](https://data.world/exercises/linear-regression-exercise-1/workspace/file?filename=cancer_reg.csv) and [here](https://data.world/xprizeai-health/expenditures-for-cancer-care). This folder contains the R code that I wrote to wrangle the data as well as apply clustering (Hierarchical and K-Means) and classification (Logistic Regression and KNN) models to find the best fitting one.
